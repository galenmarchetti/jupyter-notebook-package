# Jupyter Notebook + Database + Streamlit App

This is a free, local prototyping tool for Python developers crunching data and making visualizations. It connects Jupyter, a database of your choice, and Streamlit seamlessly for you, so you can use Jupyter to prototype your data gathering and Streamlit to prototype your data visualizations.

Specifically, this is a [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) package that deploys:

- A [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with pre-loaded SqlAlchemy/PyMongo clients, hooked into
- A database (your choice of Postgres, MongoDB, or both)
- A basic [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) App with pre-loaded database clients, automatically connected to the databases you chose to deploy

The architecture of the system on your laptop, running over Docker, will look like:

To use this prototyping tool, you just need to [install Kurtosis](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install/) and its dependencies (listed in the install guide).

## Running the Environment

1. Start with Postgres and MongoDB (default)
```
kurtosis run github.com/galenmarchetti/jupyter-notebook-package
```
2. Start with just Postgres
```
kurtosis run github.com/galenmarchetti/jupyter-notebook-package '{"mongodb_enabled": false}'
```
3. Start with just MongoDB
```
kurtosis run github.com/galenmarchetti/jupyter-notebook-package '{"postgres_enabled": false}'
```

## Prototyping your Data App

### Crunching data in Jupyter

- Go to the "notebook" URL in the output to enter the Jupyter notebook.
  - The password by default is `kurtosis`.
  - Here you can mess around with pulling data from APIs, scraping websites, and putting the results into either Postgres or MongoDB.
  - You can use `!pip install <req>` in the notebook to install more Python packages.

### Viewing the Streamlit app frontend

- Go to the "app-frontend" URL in the output to see the Streamlit app frontend

### Editing the Streamlit app

- To work on the Streamlit app, there's two ways to do it: your own IDE (slower iteration loop, but your own settings), or the pre-installed VSCode IDE (faster iteration loop, but a standard vanilla VSCode installation).
  - Pre-installed VSCode IDE: Click on the "vscode" URL in the output to open the VSCode IDE, which will modify your python files on disk.

  - Your own IDE: Clone this repository, `cd` into it, and instead of running `kurtosis run github.com/galenmarchetti/jupyter-notebook-package <ARGS>`, run the following:
    
```
kurtosis run .
```

Then, you can change your Python code using your IDE of choice, pointing it to `streamlit_app/` within this repository. Once you're done making your changes, you can re-run the above `kurtosis run .` command to create a new enclave with your changes loaded into the Streamlit service.

## Making Changes

You can make issues or submit PRs to this repository if you want to make changes, but I recommend you just fork it and take it where you want to take it. The repository defines a [Kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) package and you can go to the Kurtosis [docs](https://docs.kurtosis.com) for information on how to modify it to make it do what you need!
